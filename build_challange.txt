Build Challenge Instructions
Review the requirements and submit your completed challenge
Overview
Complete the coding challenge assignments using Java or Python. Each assignment tests specific
programming competencies and should be implemented with best practices.
Implementation Steps
• Create new Java or Python project in IDE
• Implement required classes and/or files
• Write comprehensive unit tests
• Document code with comments
Assignment 1
• Required: true
• Languages:
•   - java
•   - python
• Short Description: Build a bank account system with transaction processing and history
• Testing Objectives:
•   - Object-oriented design
•   - Collection management
•   - Transaction validation
•   - State management
• Detailed Description: Build a bank account management system that handles multiple account
types and transaction processing. The system must support two account types: CHECKING (no
minimum balance, $2.50 fee per transaction after 10 free transactions per month) and SAVINGS
(minimum balance of $100, earns 2% monthly interest, max 5 withdrawals per month).
Implement these transaction types: DEPOSIT, WITHDRAWAL, and TRANSFER (between
accounts). All transactions must be recorded with: transactionId, timestamp, type, amount,
balanceBefore, balanceAfter, and status (SUCCESS/FAILED with reason). Implement classes:
Account (accountNumber, accountType, balance, transactionHistory list,
monthlyTransactionCount), Transaction (fields listed above), and Bank (accounts map). The
Bank class must provide: openAccount(customerName, accountType, initialDeposit),
closeAccount(accountNumber) - only if balance is zero, deposit(accountNumber, amount),
withdraw(accountNumber, amount), transfer(fromAccount, toAccount, amount),
getTransactionHistory(accountNumber, startDate, endDate), applyMonthlyInterest() - for savings
accounts, and generateMonthlyStatement(accountNumber) - showing all transactions and
ending balance. Reject transactions that would result in negative balance or violate account
rules. Demonstrate with at least 4 accounts and 20 transactions including failed attempts.
Assignment 2
• Required: true
• Languages:
•   - java
•   - python
• Short Description: Create a student gradebook with weighted categories and GPA calculation
• Testing Objectives:
•   - Arithmetic calculations
•   - Nested data structures
•   - Weighted averages
•   - Data validation and formatting
• Detailed Description: Create a student gradebook system that tracks assignments across
weighted categories and calculates final grades. Each course has grading categories with
weights that must total 100%: HOMEWORK (20%), QUIZZES (20%), MIDTERM (25%),
FINAL_EXAM (35%). Each category can have multiple assignments, and the category score is
the average of all assignments within it. Final course grade is the weighted sum of category
averages. Letter grades are assigned as: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below
60). GPA points are: A=4.0, B=3.0, C=2.0, D=1.0, F=0.0. Implement classes: Assignment (name,
pointsEarned, pointsPossible, category), Course (courseName, creditHours, categories map
with weights, assignments list), Student (studentId, name, courses list), and GradeBook
(students map). The GradeBook class must provide: addStudent(studentId, name),
enrollInCourse(studentId, courseName, creditHours), addAssignment(studentId, courseName,
assignment), getCategoryAverage(studentId, courseName, category),
getCourseGrade(studentId, courseName) - returns percentage and letter grade,
calculateGPA(studentId) - weighted by credit hours, and generateTranscript(studentId) 
formatted report showing all courses with grades and cumulative GPA. Handle edge cases:
missing assignments scored as zero, categories with no assignments excluded from calculation.
Demonstrate with 3 students each enrolled in 2-3 courses with varying assignments.
